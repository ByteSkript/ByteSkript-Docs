# Action (ask)

{% hint style="danger" %}
This feature is not yet present, but provided as an example users can expect.
{% endhint %}

Action scripts are written in `.ask` (**a**ction **sk**ript) files.

They are designed for single-run tasks, rather than to be compiled into fully-developed programs.

These scripts cannot contain members but are still able to use lambdas, the lemma-form section and various other deferred subroutines.

Scripts may contain single-line `// comments` or multi-line `/* comments */`.
